        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>After Highschool, I went into the construction field. HVAC to be exact.
            I learned quickly from a helper to running full-size commerical jobs. With a passion for music burning inside of me from an early age,
            I decided to go to school for Music Production. From there I started producing my own music and djing small New York City parties. Fast 
            forward a few years and many failed projects(lol). I was playing some of the best national venues and festivals in the area! Now I am 1/2 
            of a duo with my fiance called He Said, She Said. Still playing and producing Techno, working with international record labels like Nervous Records. 
        </p>
        <p>I know that dedication, hardwork and faith can get you where you want to be. It's not always easy but if its truly what you want it will be worth it.</p>
        <p>I also have a big background in customer service. Which i use allday everyday. A smile, a good attitude and helping your client achive exactly what they want 
            are big keys to success!
        </p>
        <p>I'm very excited to continue on my new software engineering career path.</p>
